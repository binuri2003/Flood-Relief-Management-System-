We develop a web based Flood Relief Management System to support the collection and management of basic data during flood situations in Sri Lanka. The system must allow affected individuals to register, submit flood relief requests, and enable an administrator to manage users and monitor relief data through summarized reports. The project must be implemented using the technologies taught in the module, with role based access control.
